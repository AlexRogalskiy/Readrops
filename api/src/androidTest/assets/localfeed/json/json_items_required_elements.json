In fact, you might even notice that some things are actually faster and it can now open HEIF images. How awesome is that?</p>\n<p>I&#39;m also working on some 10.13 goodies for Acorn 6 folks later this year. I can&#39;t wait to share that with you, but you&#39;ll have to wait just a little bit.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Happy summer solstice everybody! (at least for folks in the northern hemisphere, and for folks in the southâ€¦ sorry. It&#39;s going to start getting brighter for you though).</p>\n<p>Today I&#39;ve got a pair of minor app updates to annouce for you.</p>\n<p>First up is <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">Acorn 6.1.3</a>, which <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/releasenotes.html\">fixes a number of bugs</a> including one that stemmed from trying to use QuickLook on a file that was created with Acorn 1.0. For the one or two of you that this was affecting, hurray!</p>\n<p>Next up is <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/\">Retrobatch</a>, which also <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/releasenotes.html\">includes some bug fixes</a>, the beginnings of Voice Over support, performance improvements, and more.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s next for these apps? Work on Acorn 6.2 will begin shortly, as will Retrobatch 1.1. WWDC introduced some great new APIs that I want to take advantage of (cool new machine learning things), so that&#39;ll be a focus- as well as Dark Mode for Acorn and one other major thing I&#39;ve got planned. Retrobatch will probably also get the Dark Mode treatment, but not until I&#39;ve done it for Acorn first.</p>\n<p>So it&#39;s going to be a busy summer, but I&#39;m looking forward to it.</p>\n",
